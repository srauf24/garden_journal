I understand you want to initialize or start a new project. Let me help you explore the current project structure first. Let me help you explore the project structure. I see this is a monorepo project with the following main components:

1. **Apps directory** - Contains two main applications:
   - `backend/` - Go-based REST API
   - `frontend/` - TypeScript/React web application
2. **Packages directory** - Shared libraries and components
3. **Configuration files**:
   - `package.json` - Node.js project configuration
   - `turbo.json` - Turborepo configuration for monorepo management
   - `bun.lock` - Dependency lock file using Bun package manager

The project uses modern technology stack:
- Go 1.24+ for backend
- TypeScript/React for frontend
- PostgreSQL 16+ for database
- Redis 8+ for background jobs
- Clerk for authentication
- New Relic for monitoring
- Resend for email services

Would you like me to:
1. Explore the frontend application structure
2. Explore the backend application structure
3. Look at shared packages
4. Check the specific files or areas you're interested in

What would you like to explore first?
